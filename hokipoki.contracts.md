title: Execute Lottery
summary: This action takes a game id. It must be invoked with the active permission of `hokipoki`.

The face value for these tickets stays at 0. If there are more tickets than students, then for each remaining ticket, the owner stays as `hokipoki`, but their face value is updated to the price that was specified when the game was created. All tickets for the game are no longer reserved for the lottery.
